## AI Usage Summary

- **Diagramming:**  
  We used dbdiagram.io solely for drawing and exporting the ERD diagram image, based on our team’s original database design. No AI was used to generate or design the database structure, relationships, or business logic.

- **Grammar and Syntax Checking:**  
  AI tools were used for grammar and syntax checking in documentation, and for code syntax verification. No business logic, technical explanations, or reflection content was generated by AI.

- **Research:**  
  We used AI tools to research MySQL best practices (such as index usage and constraint recommendations). All research was cited where appropriate.

- **Attribution:**  
  All technical explanations, database design, and documentation are original and team-specific. Any AI-assisted code or text is clearly marked and limited to non-logic tasks.
